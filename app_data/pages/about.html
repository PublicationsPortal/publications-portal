  <h3 class="ui header">Introduction</h3>
  <p>The European Spallation Source (ESS) is committed to the dissemination and preservation of
    scientific knowledge and research outcomes produced within our institution. To achieve this, we
    have established a Repository called ESS Research Portal (ERP) that will house records of our
    scientific activities. Content may include but is not limited to research papers, conference
    papers, media content and any other scientific activity conducted by affiliates of our facility.
    This policy outlines the guidelines and procedures for adding content to the repository,
    ensuring that it accurately reflects the scientific contributions of our affiliated researchers.

  <h3 class="ui header">Source of Repository Content</h3>
  <p>The content of the ESS Repository is primarily sourced from Scopus, which is a comprehensive
    abstract and citation database. Scopus provides a wide range of scientific literature, including
    peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, patents, and other scholarly sources.
  </p>
  <p>The repository aims to capture and preserve all relevant research activities and publications
    affiliated with the ESS available in Scopus. However, we acknowledge that certain scientific
    activities and publications may not be included in Scopus. To address this, researchers are
    encouraged to inform the ESS Library about such activities, ensuring they are not missed out.
  </p>
  <h4 class="ui horizontal header divider">
  </h4>
  <h3 class="ui header">Source of Repository Content</h3>
  <p>The following criteria must be met for content to be included in the repository:
  </p>
  <ul class="ui list">
    <li>The content must have scientific value and be relevant to the fields of research conducted
      at the ESS.</li>
    <li>The content must have been produced or published while the author were affiliated with the
      ESS. </li>
    <li>The content must involve contributions by individuals affiliated with the ESS.</li>
    <li>Content may include but is not limited to research papers, conference papers, interviews,
      keynote presentations, media appearances, and any other scientific activities conducted by
      researchers affiliated with ESS.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 class="ui horizontal header divider">
  </h4>
  <h3 class="ui header">Data Entry and Maintenance</h3>
  <ul class="ui list">
    <li>Most data included in the repository is populated by data extracted from Scopus. However,
      activities and publications not present in Scopus will not be included unless researchers
      inform the ESS Library about them. To ensure that no relevant scientific activities are
      missed, researchers are encouraged to notify the library when they have been published via
      outlets not expected to be in Scopus. The library will then manually add these records to the
      repository.</li>
    <li>All records in the repository will have their metadata maintained and updated by the ESS
      Library staff.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 class="ui horizontal header divider">
  </h4>
  <h3 class="ui header">Accessibility and Open Access</h3>
  <ul class="ui list">
    <li>All records added to the repository will be made public and searchable, subject to any
      necessary embargo periods or copyright restrictions.</li>
    <li>For materials that are Open Access, a link to the full-text file will be provided within the
      repository, enhancing accessibility for the broader scientific community.</li>
    <li>When possible, a full text document will be available for reading or download on the
      individual record page. This requires that the document fulfills Gold standard Open Access.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 class="ui horizontal header divider">
  </h4>
  <h3 class="ui header">Digital Object Identifier (DOI)</h3>
  <ul class="ui list">
    <li>Each document or record added to the repository will be assigned relevant DOI to ensure its
      persistent identification.</li>
    <li>In cases where the record is based on research conducted at the ESS Research Facility, a
      separate DOI will be assigned to represent the research process itself. In these cases, a
      record will have two DOIâ€™s. One associated with the instrument used and one associated with
      the article produced.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="ui header">Repository Updates and Changes</h3>
  <p>This policy may be subject to periodic review and updates to reflect changing best practices
    and the evolving needs of ESS.
